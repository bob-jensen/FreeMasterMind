Free Master Mind  By Bob Jensen

This was an off hours learning project, part HTML 5 investigation, Javascript refresh project,
and a intro into html across laptops, phones and tablets.

I wanted to keep it as simple as possible so no libraries, just the basics.

HTML 5 features
1. Save files for off line use, this allows one to play when one is disconnected from the internet.
    + Great for my IPad.
    - Annoying dialog about saving local data on some browsers
    - Getting rid of the app requires clearing private data from browser

2. Drag and drop
    + Easy and it works on the laptop.
    - Does not work on mobile

3. SVG Scalable Vector Graphics.
    + Worked great. The old school way would have required 34 images just for the code, hole,  and balls.
    e.g. red ball in  green hole...  Instead I used SVG instead.  No images required for that.
    + Page loads faster
    + Resize SVG items stay crystal clear
    - Unfortunately some browsers do not support HTML5 SVG yet.

Master Mind is a classic game, one improvement I made was to eliminate the extra pegs to
show the clues.  I use the guess hole background color instead.
This reduces the form factor and added more color to the app.
It also made it easier to see match the clues to the ball, well in easy mode any way.
